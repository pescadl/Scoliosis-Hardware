 *
 *  @brief      CC2640R2DK_4XS Board Specific header file.
 *
 *  The CC2640R2DK_4XS header file should be included in an application as
 *  follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include "CC2640R2DK_4XS.h"
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  This board file is made for the 4x4 mm QFN package, to convert this board
 *  file to use for other smaller device packages please refer to the table
 *  below which lists the max IOID values supported by each package. All other
 *  unused pins should be set to IOID_UNUSED.
 *
 *  Furthermore the board file is also used
 *  to define a symbol that configures the RF front end and bias.
 *  See the comments below for more information.
 *  For an in depth tutorial on how to create a custom board file, please refer
 *  to the section "Running the SDK on Custom Boards" with in the Software
 *  Developer's Guide.
 *
 *  Refer to the datasheet for all the package options and IO descriptions:
 *  http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc2640r2f.pdf
